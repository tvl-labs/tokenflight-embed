description: Send and receive crypto payments inside a chat conversation with an embedded receive widget.

import ChatDemo from '../../../components/ChatDemo.astro';

Messaging apps can embed payment request widgets directly into the conversation — users pay from any chain without switching apps.

This example shows a friend-to-friend payment flow: Alice sends a payment request, and the recipient can fulfill it with any token from any chain, settling in USDC on Base.

## Layout

The chat container uses **auto height** — no fixed constraint — so the full conversation is always visible. The widget renders inside a chat bubble that takes the full available width. Do **not** set a `min-width` on the bubble, as chat layouts need to adapt to narrow mobile screens.

Use `setCustomColors()` after `initialize()` to match the widget accent to your chat app's brand color (e.g. Telegram blue `#6AB2F2`).

## Integration Notes

- Use `hideTitle: true` to remove the widget header and let the chat bubble provide its own context (e.g. "Payment Request" label above the widget).
- The `amount` prop locks the payment to a specific value, preventing the sender from modifying it — useful for invoices and split bills.
- The `onSwapSuccess` callback can mark the message as "Paid" and send a confirmation message in the chat.
- Consider setting the widget theme to match your chat app's color scheme.

## Code Snippet

```js
import { TokenFlightReceive, registerElements } from '@tokenflight/swap';

registerElements();

const receive = new TokenFlightReceive({
  container: '#chat-payment-widget',
  config: {
    target: {
      chainId: 8453,
      address: '0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913',
    },
    amount: '25',
    theme: 'dark',
    hideTitle: true,
  },
  callbacks: {
    onSwapSuccess: (data) => {
      markMessageAsPaid();
      sendConfirmation('Payment of $25 USDC received!');
    },
  },
});
receive.initialize();

// Match your chat app's brand color
receive.setCustomColors({
  primary: '#6AB2F2',
  'accent-light': 'rgba(106, 178, 242, 0.1)',
  'accent-glow': 'rgba(106, 178, 242, 0.2)',
});
```
