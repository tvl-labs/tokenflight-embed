description: Embed TokenFlight swap and receive widgets directly in a social media timeline.
---

import SocialFeedDemo from '../../../components/SocialFeedDemo.astro';

Social platforms can embed cross-chain swap widgets directly in the feed — users interact with DeFi without leaving the timeline.

This example shows two common patterns:

- **Swap post**: A project promotes token bridging with a swap widget attached to a post
- **Receive post**: A merchant accepts crypto payments via a receive widget, letting users pay from any chain

<SocialFeedDemo />

## Integration Notes

- The widget fits naturally inside a card/embed container. Set `noBorder` and `noBackground` if the host card already provides its own chrome.
- Use `fromToken` / `toToken` presets to guide users toward a specific swap pair, or leave them open for free selection.
- The `onSwapSuccess` callback can trigger in-app notifications (e.g. "Payment confirmed!") without navigating away from the feed.

## Code Snippet

```js
import { TokenFlightSwap, TokenFlightReceive, registerElements } from '@tokenflight/swap';

registerElements();

// Swap widget inside a feed card
const swap = new TokenFlightSwap({
  container: '#post-swap-widget',
  config: {
    theme: 'dark',
    fromToken: { chainId: 1, address: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000' },
    toToken:   { chainId: 8453, address: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000' },
  },
  callbacks: {
    onSwapSuccess: (data) => showToast('Swap completed!'),
  },
});
swap.initialize();

// Receive widget for payment posts
const receive = new TokenFlightReceive({
  container: '#post-receive-widget',
  config: {
    target: { chainId: 8453, address: '0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913' },
    amount: '25',
    theme: 'dark',
  },
  callbacks: {
    onSwapSuccess: (data) => showToast('Payment received!'),
  },
});
receive.initialize();
```
