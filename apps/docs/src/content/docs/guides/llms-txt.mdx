title: llms.txt for AI Tools
description: TokenFlight docs publish machine-readable indexes at /llms.txt and /llms-full.txt for AI assistants and retrieval pipelines.
---

TokenFlight docs provide LLM-friendly indexes so AI tools can discover documentation pages quickly.

## Endpoints

- `https://embed.tokenflight.ai/llms.txt`
- `https://embed.tokenflight.ai/llms-full.txt`

## Which One to Use

- `llms.txt` - concise index for routing and quick context selection.
- `llms-full.txt` - fuller page summaries for retrieval and grounding.

## Typical Usage

Use these files when you are building:

- AI assistants that answer SDK integration questions.
- RAG pipelines that need a stable docs index.
- Internal tooling that maps user intent to docs URLs.

## Example

```bash
curl -s https://embed.tokenflight.ai/llms.txt
curl -s https://embed.tokenflight.ai/llms-full.txt
```

Both files are generated from the current docs content and update as documentation changes.
